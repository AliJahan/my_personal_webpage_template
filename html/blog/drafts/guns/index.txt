Here's a thought experiment: right now, there are a lot of guns in the United States



Thanks for bringing this up Ben.  After reading through all of these comments and positively itching to chime in on all of them, I realized I didn't have a good understanding of gun violence in America.  So, I spent this morning doing some research:


FBI Murder Circumstances by Weapon, 2010
https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10shrtbl11.xls

13,000 total murder victims
68% with firearms, mostly handguns
13% with knives

Circumstances
36% unknown circumstances
25% attributed to "other arguments"
15% were felony-in-progress, with robbery being most common, followed by narcotic & other
14% unknown non-felony-in-progress circumstances

For all circumstances, 68% were firearms
0% rape victims killed by firearm
77% robbery victims killed by firearm
84% narcotic drug laws
73% unknown

The fact that 50% of circumstances were unknown makes it hard to draw generalizations.  You could imagine that the 50% roughly follows the same distribution of the 50% known.  But you could also imagine that there are categories inside the known 50% that are proportionally misrepresented.  I'll have to do more resarch or ask an expert as a next step.

However, even though we can't generalize yet, we can still contemplate the data as is, knowing that each percentage WILL NOT SHRINK.  For example, AT LEAST 25% of homicides had "other arguments" as their circumstances, with the theore maximum being 75%.






50.4 percent were black, 47.0 white

"We have a different culture here" should be a secondary consideration in this debate.  Culture can change over time.  Let's fast-forward time 100 years.  Everyone who is alive right now will be dead.  In our places, there will be a completely new set of Americans, and THEY will be guardians of their culture.  If we start now





Guns are inanimate objects devoid of inherent morality.  We as humans use guns as tools for three things:

1. Sport (hunting, target shooting)
2. Deterrent/Intimidation (Thinking about robbing a convenience store?  Not if there's a biker gang inside!)
3. Killing (immediate and irreversible ending of life)






Another thought experiment:

Guns are designed and optimized for one thing: projecting force at a distance.  However, it is not unreasonable to think that they have reached global maximum efficiency in this.  Let's say a new type of gun gets invented.  A laser gun!

* The gun shoots lasers, so the "bullets" travel at the speed of light
* The gun has a targeting computer, which is 100% accurate in identifying who you want to shoot at, and is 100% accurate in shooting at that thing
* The gun has sufficient power to instantly vaporize a watermelon-sized hole in flesh
* The gun's laser beam cannot be deflected by any known means
* The gun costs $10

So, people now have this cool gun that is really smart.  Accidental gun deaths drop to zero (because it's 100% accurate in figuring out what you want to shoot).  Gun suicide numbers stay the same (percent would increase due to zero accidental gun deaths).  Gun homicide numbers?

People without guns would be powerless to defend themselves.  Arms race?

What we're left with is kind of a Frankenstein situation.



People we want to have guns:

* People who would never use the gun except in ethically sound situations in sport, deterrent, and killing

* People who would use the gun in ethically UN-sound situations in sport, deterrent, and killing





How hard is it to buy a gun?

Normal people in normal state of mind don't kill people.  People can transition between being stable and unstable.

If you want to own a gun, you should have to subject yourself to ongoing public scrutiny.
