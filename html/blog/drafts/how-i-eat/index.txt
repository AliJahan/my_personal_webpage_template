Just over a month ago, I committed to try a new way of eating:

> I will not eat inhumanely farmed meat.


I define "inhumanely farmed" as the animals are subjected to undue suffering during their lives and/or deaths.

This has been somewhat of a long time coming.  I took an environmental ethics class at Santa Clara, have seen a couple documentaries about the American food industry, and have a couple of close friends who are vegan.  For a long time, I've known the relevant facts surrounding meat consumption, but I never <strong>really thought</strong> about how it applied to myself.

Here's what I considered:

* Most meat at grocery stores and in restaurants is inhumanely farmed

* Purchasing inhumanely farmed products directly supports these unethical practices

* Inhumanely farmed meat consumption is not necessary for the human body to survive and thrive



Given these facts, the conclusion is obvious; it is unethical to eat inhumanely farmed meat, a conclusion only strengthened by these additional convenience factors:

* I already rarely cook with meat at home
* Almost every restaurant has options 


When I told my good friend Ryan Tsao about this, he immediately asked:

1. What constitutes "humanely farmed meat"?
  * Wild-caught fish
  * Free range chicken
  * Grass-fed ranch cattle
  * Or more generally: any animal that lives a good life and dies a clean death

2. What about other inhumanely farmed animal products?
  * Eggs and dairy mostly
