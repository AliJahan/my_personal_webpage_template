## Day 1

Today was quite the day.  I woke up very early and drove out to Visalia, CA to meet Kelly at 0900.  I previously scoped out an enormous hotel parking lot that was also host to a Sequoia National Park shuttle bus that allowed overnight parking, so we met up there and consolidated into one car to save the outrageous entry fee that bit us last time.  A couple hours up the winding road and we arrived at the Mineral King ranger station.

As usual, we didn't have a permit secured ahead of time (or even a route planned, for that matter), but they had a few left for the two least popular trails.  We picked Farewell Gap since all that matters is which trail you *enter* on your first day, and Farewell Gap gave us some access to the big mountains that looked so neat on the map.  We crammed into a questionable parking spot (there were none left), finished packing, and hit the trail!

The trail started as a nice, easy climb through a nice lower meadow, but the entire time you can see where it's heading: up up up to Farewell Gap, which is a notch pass between two huge pyramid peaks.  For some unknown reason, once the trail got steeper my heart rate started getting out of control.  It was beating really quickly and seemingly inefficiently, almost like I had low blood pressure.  This caused me to really slow us down because I didn't want to push it too hard.
