    h1 #[img.me(src="/~ajaha004/files/pic.jpg")] Hi, I'm Ali
    p I'm a research assistant at University of California, Riverside. I joined #[a(href='http://www.danielwong.org/socal.html') SoCal] in Fall 2017.
    
    P I work on the intersection of machine learning systems and energy-efficient computing. I have extensive experience in designing software and hardware systems for emerging applications in diverse computational environments, ranging from embedded systems to multi-GPU systems and data centers. I am exploring system and architectural limitations of autonomous vehicles software pipeline, and challenges in integrating edge computing devices in self-driving cars. Recent highlights include:
    ul
      li
        p Developed Deep Learning solutions in resource-constrained environments (i.e. aerial drones).
      li 
        p Benchmarking, evaluating, and improving energy-efficiency of multi-GPU ML systems.
      li
        p Reinforcement learning-based power and resource management for co-located Cloud and ML workloads in Data Centers.
